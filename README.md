## 🛡️ H1B Filtering Logic

Jobs are filtered in two ways:

**Blocked (H1B = NO):** skipped automatically if description contains:
- "no sponsorship", "must be authorized", "no visa", "citizens only", etc.

**Confirmed (H1B = YES):** flagged as promising if description contains:
- "visa sponsorship", "will sponsor", "h1b", "sponsorship available", etc.

**Unknown:** included with a caution flag (many companies don't mention it in JD)

|---|---|
| GitHub Actions | **Free** (2,000 min/month for private repos) |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**No jobs found**: Many career sites block scrapers. If a company returns 0 jobs, manually find their RSS feed or use their API. LinkedIn, Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday all have public APIs.

**Emails not sending**: Double-check your Gmail App Password. Make sure 2FA is enabled and you're using the App Password (not your login password).

**ATS scores all 70**: The Anthropic API key is missing or has no credit. Check your console.anthropic.com balance.

**GitHub Actions not running**: Check that the workflow file is at exactly `.github/workflows/job_hunt.yml` in your repo.
